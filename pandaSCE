Example of statistics in R commander while analyzing Single Case Experiment data with an ABA design (instead of DatasetRANDASSSIGN, use your own file's name). 
Make sure to have R commander to be able to analyze this kind of data: 

#libraries you will need for single case randomized studies# use the typical R FUNCTION to install the packages first## 
library(Rcmdr)
library(car)
library(RcmdrMisc)
####

# Observed statistics#
``` Rcmdr>  observed(design = "ABA", statistic = "A-B", data = DatasetRANDASSIGN)```
# p value#
``` Rcmdr>  pvalue.systematic(design = "ABA", statistic = "A-B", limit = 3, data = Rcmdr+  DatasetRANDASSIGN)```
# Effect size#
``` Rcmdr>  ES(design = "ABA", ES = "SMD", data = DatasetRANDASSIGN)
```
# graphic plot#
```{r}graph(design = "ABA", data = DatasetRANDASSIGN)```


#analysis of single case experiment# change only the dataset name and the file path that appears here and replace with yours on your terminal###
```{r}Datasettwnty <- readXL("D:/RM second year/Practicals/SINGLE CASE EXPR/01A.DATAuseonlyforanalysis/DatasetSC.xlsx",
rownames=FALSE, header=TRUE, na="", sheet="Blad1", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)```

##To create a randomization schedule (randomize the treatment to your patient/participant)## Notice in this case my example has 18 and 3 as MT and L, but you shall add
your own numbers on the basis of the theory that holds your method and of what do you want to assess or experiment with##

Randomization schedule 

Study design: ABA withdrawal design
SCRT package (BultÃ© & Onghena, 2013).
Measurement Times (MT) =18
Limit =3

#R script starts#
quantity(design = "ABA", MT = 18, limit = 3)
assignments(design = "ABA", MT = 18, limit = 3, save = "no")
selectdesign(design = "ABA", MT = 18, limit = 3)
Rcmdr>  selectdesign(design = "ABA", MT = 18, limit = 3)
#R script ends#
